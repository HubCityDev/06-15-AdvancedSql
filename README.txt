All examples listed here were the ones used during the presentation.  Each script is not a complete script,
in other words, not meant to run from start to finish - but run in blocks as handy 'snippets' and examples.

To run these examples, go to:
http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/93587
and download the Adventureworks2012 sample database.  Right click your database node in SQL Server Management Studio,
and click "attach", navigating to the file you downloaded.  

If you need to install SQL Server itself for evaluation or learning puroses, you can find the 180 evaluation version
